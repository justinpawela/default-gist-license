# Welcome

Below is the default license applied to all public Gists that I publish, unless a specific Gist indicates otherwise. Secret Gists are not licensed for any use; I retain all rights.

The Gists are found at: [gist.github.com/justinpawela](https://gist.github.com/justinpawela)

I tend to prefer the ISC License due to its permissive nature and somewhat more condensed composition (compared to equivalents such as MIT, BSD, etc.).

Thanks for visiting!
